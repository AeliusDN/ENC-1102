      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
      <p>Here I will argue my case for why I've met and mastered each course outcome required by ENC 1102.</p>
      <h2>Generating Inquiry</h2>
      <p>Based on outcomes listed in the Department of Writing and Rhetoric’s website, I
understand this outcome to mean that by the end of this course I should be able to contribute
meaningful inquiry to a past or present subject that is related to writing, language, literacy, and/or
rhetoric. In other words, I should be able to look at a critical conversation and make interesting,
involved questions in it which relate to writing.</p>
      <p>I argue that I met this outcome because I found and established a niche research subject
out of a pre-existing critical conversation that contributed with unique research, conclusions, and
data. In my Potential Research Questions assignment, I illustrate this through my very first
proposed research question, “Why has script writing become such a structured form of
writing/development that there are definitive taboos for script writers?” (Scruggs, 2025, 3). This
first research question establishes a very involved and educated line of inquiry that relates itself
to writing in a meaningful and inventive manner. By generating inquiry in something I’m already
knowledgeable and interested in, I found a niche topic related to coding rhetoric that was worth
investigating. On the other hand, if I had chosen a subject that I wasn’t knowledgeable or
interested in I would likely have made an uninventive research article that would likely have
already been answered. In addition to this, my Genuine Inquiry Reading Response also
displays my understanding of generating inquiry through my direct reflection of my initial
learning of it at the beginning of the semester: “[Genuine inquiry] is driven by the desire to ask
meaningful questions and explore the unknown rather than merely confirming preconceived
answers or beliefs.” (Scruggs, 2025, 1). This very early artifact demonstrates the understanding
and commitment to the involvement of the generated inquiry and how it contributes new
knowledge. It’s very much in opposition to clean and organized research which likely wouldn’t
take much time or effort to commit to because the outcomes and conclusions may be obvious. In
other words, research questions about the obvious are rarely interesting or contribute to a
meaningful conversation, thus genuine inquiry is spurred by involved and intelligent thought into
an interested subject</p>
