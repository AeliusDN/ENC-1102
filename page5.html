        <h2>Synthesis Note Chart</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>    In the synthesis chart I analyzed multiple secondary sources for credibility and relevance. However, my 
          research topic being as niche as it is, forced me to interpret and pull sources with creative relations to my 
          topic. This helped further my information literacy as it made me look past surface level information and more 
          deeply understand what information I was handling. It also helps demonstrate how my skills and topic were further 
          refined by the necessitations and environment where they were used.</p>

        <h2>Annotated Bibliography/Literature Review Rough Draft</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>    The annotated bibliography was my next big step in interpreting information that wasn’t my own and would only 
          seemingly apply to my research glancingly. It deepened my information literacy by having me not only interpret my 
          secondary sources and relate them to my research question, but to also explain them back to a reader/audience 
          which may or may not be familiar with the subject. It pushed me to think of not only the literacy in others’ work 
          but also in my work, in other words, how people would interpret my work.</p>

        <h2>Eportfolio Reflection 2</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>    This reflection assignment had me prepare to think about the upsides and downsides to digital formats 
          over traditional formats and prepare how I would use the strengths of digital formats, such as websites, to 
          complement my research. This use and understanding of different methods of writing my research would become 
          essential in illustrating my knowledge of my topic, so it became imperative to best understand how I should and
          shouldn’t use digital media to illustrate my intentions. These digital mediums become a clearly different way of 
          writing and involve different skills and understanding to perform effectively, thus it advanced my skills in 
          using multiple ways of writing.</p>

        <h2>Annotated Bibliography/Literature Review Peer Reviewed</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>    This specific peer review activity was a great foray into revision for not only myself but others. I haven’t 
          had too many opportunities for peer reviews in the past so I struggled to come up with meaningful criticisms that
          added to the subject rather than simply uplifting or demoralizing the creator of the object in question. Through 
          understanding others’ criticisms of my work did I understand more of my own, and how it might be interpreted by a 
          wider audience. It was a significant opportunity for refinement.</p>
