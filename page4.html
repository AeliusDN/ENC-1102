        <h2>Potential Research Questions</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>    This assignment helped prepare me for generating inquiry by having me think on deeper, unanswered questions within other genres and critical conversations. I had to think about genuine thoughts and developments that could contribute to an understanding of a topic or audience and was 
          meaningful to said topic or audience. Prior to this class I had only written or “researched” topics that others had already delved deeply into and answered for themselves, I was simply regurgitating their findings and interpretations, thus genuine inquiry was a rather unpolished skill for me.</p>

        <h2>Reading Response: Genuine Inquiry</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>    The genuine inquiry reading response had me respond to text by Kenneth Burke about critical conversations, genre, and how to meaningfully contribute and understand them. The response to his reading helped me to contextualize the lesson and better understand how there is a clear difference
          in genuine inquiry and ingenuine inquiry. Genuine inquiry will easily contribute to a conversation by filling a niche and granting an entire audience a fuller understanding of what they are researching together, however ingenuine inquiry will only regurgitate information someone else has already 
          discovered or will ineffectually research a topic that no one seems to care about or is unable to have a clear conclusion or interpretation. Genuine inquiry is essential to having genuine research, and only by genuine research can you advance your critical conversation.</p>

        <h2>Research Proposal</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>    This assignment was a major assignment with the intention of presenting my research proposal, methods, reasons, objectives, and timeline for the project. It’s very clear that it forced me to think several steps ahead to organize and plan how I would conduct my research. Previously, I hadn’t
          ever presented a research proposal in such detail, and I quickly found it very helpful, planning out the project so far in advance. It significantly improved my speed and quality of production and research. The research proposal became a foundation for everything that came after it, and although 
          some parts had changed through development, it’s still very clearly the forefather to the rest of my research.</p>

        <h2>Reading Response: Primary Research Methods</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>    This assignment really started to make me think about how I should best research and illustrate my research question. It helped me understand which methods would add to my writing and research and which would take away from it. That’s not to say some were superior to others, but each 
          method had specific use cases, and this helped me to better understand how I should produce my project. It had helped me plan out how I should prepare, conduct, and present my research. I ended up choosing interviews because those seemed to contribute the most and provide the best quality 
          data I could get, due to the quantity of VX Ace users today, their skill levels, availability, and complexity of questions I had for them.</p>
