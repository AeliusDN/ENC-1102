      <h2>About This Portfolio</h2>
      <p>This ENC 1102 portfolio is a curated collection of work, reflection, and research created over the course of the semester. It serves as both a personal archive and an academic showcase of progress through the course outcomes and project phases.</p>
      <p>This page is dedicated towards explaining key subjects or topics of my chosen genre.</p>

        <h2>What is RPGM?</h2>
        <p>RPGM (RPG Maker) is a series of rookie game development programs produced by Kadokawa Corporation. RPG Maker is made to be extremely simple for new developers as well as having tools available for more experienced developers in the form of scripting or plugins.</p>
        <p>This research project specifically used RPGM VX Ace. VX ace was released in the west on March 12, 2012 and allows the use of RGSS3 scripting for extended use of the engine (Ruby Script).</p>

        <h2>What is scripting?</h2>
        <p>Scripting specifically refers to the use of "scripts". Scripts are self contained snippets of code typically written in an interpreter -- coding programs that read and execute each line of code one by one. Some of the most commonly used languages for scripting are Ruby and Java.</p>
        <p>Many game engines use scripting not as their base code but rather as a user interface for external developers not directly associated with the producer. In this case, RPGM is made by Kadokawa in the engine's base code, and game developers using the engine use the scripting system.</p>

      <div class="column">
        <h2>What is a "game engine"?</h2>
        <p>Put simply, a game engine is a program used to make and run a video game. For a simple analogy, think of an artist using a pen. The pen (game engine) was made in a factory while the art you make with the pen (the game) was made by an indiviual. The game engine is the means of making the game.</p>
        <p>Be that as it may, there are plenty of companies that make their own inhouse engine to run their videogames, and plenty of individual people that made their own engine and game. Some examples of game engines would Unreal Engine, Godot, Unity, and Source Engine.</p>
