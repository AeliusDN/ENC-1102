        <h2>Primary Interviews</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>    My primary interviews were my first real foray into personal research for an official topic and preparing to 
          present that independent research. The accumulation of new data and knowledge and then relaying an interpretation
          of that back to an audience was a very clear development of contributing knowledge to a critical conversation. I 
          learned much of how I should organize my thoughts and ask questions of others that would benefit the research 
          clearly.</p>

        <h2>Reading Response: Analyzing Primary Data</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>    This assignment help to further my interpretation of my data so I can most efficiently interpret and present my
          interpretation as well as other interpretations of my data to readers. Specifically, it helped me to better
          understand how I should code data. Previously, I had only ever really seen this form of informational coding in 
          museums and libraries, but I soon understood it simply as a tagging system for information, not for users to better
          find he research, but to better link essential parts of research to create/understand a certain interpretation of 
          it. I hadn’t really thought of presenting information this way and it significantly bolstered my contribution of 
          knowledge towards my critical conversation.</p>

        <h2>Coding Reflection</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>    I think this assignment dramatically helped me to write in another
          way – steering readers towards an interpretation or understanding that I otherwise struggled to convey literally or
          was better understood unwritten in some form. The aspect of coding most enjoyed by users is the ability to conjoin 
          seemingly disparate information into a smooth path that illustrates an author or researcher’s line of thinking when
          reaching a conclusion. This not only is very effective and saves time, but also can help contribute to a more innate
          understanding of the subject for not only the audience, but also the creator. This is not without some learning and 
          skill though, as improperly using coding can only convolute data when misused. It’s essential to get an accurate 
          and professional understanding of how to use coding.</p>

        <h2>Research Paper Peer Review</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>    This one was a great deal more complicated than the last peer review, as it concerned the entire research 
          article and included requirements and information that wasn’t present in the annotated bibliographies. Now having 
          refined my peer review skills from the first peer review assignment, this one gave me an opportunity to showcase 
          how I had grown my revision skills, and I ended up with almost twice as many meaningful comments as I did in the 
          last assignment. It was significantly easier to generate meaningful support and criticism for others’ work.</p>
