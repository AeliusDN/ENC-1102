        <p>This was the first draft of my first major assignment - the Annotated Bibliography and Literature Review. It was a bit rough, highlighting several problems such as formatting issues, unsatisfactory explaination of niche subjects or terms, or falling short in secondary source analysis.</p>

      <div class="textbox">
        <p>The peer reviewed version of my Annotated Bibliography had made several changes, becoming more understandable to the uninitiated and fixing many previous formatting issues or grammatical errors.</p>

      <div class="subheader">Final Draft</div>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>Highlighted in blue are the final changes I made to my Annotated Bibliography. By then, I had resolved almost all of the issues with my annotated bibliography and literature review, and only a few more changes were necessary. My work was very solid, all I had left to fix was to expand on my analysis
        of my sources a bit more, so I futher related them more precisely to my research question, aiming more towards rhetoric. I also took the opportunity to relate them more towards my own experiences as a developer as well, trying to gain a bit more credibility and relate some of the more complicated topics
        to a real world occurence.</p>

    <section>
      <div class="header">Final Research Paper</div>
      <div class="subheader">Rough Draft</div>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>This was the first draft of my final research paper; by now I had become much more aligned with my research purpose and writing came more freely. My first draft lacked many of the issues my Annotated Bibliography and Literature Review did, and was generally much more polished, requiring less refinement
        than my first major assignment.</p>

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <section>
      <div class="subheader">Peer Review</div>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>Fewer revisions were necessary for this major assignment than in the last one, but one major issue I still had was failing to explain much of my research genre to the reader. Uninitiated readers would be left behind and likely confused or simply not understand my paper at all, so I elaborated much more
        on my genre and research.</p>

    <!-- Section 6 -->
    <section>
      <div class="subheader">Final Draft</div>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>By now my research paper had become very durable, but the last major issue I had to fix was in my research question itself. Through my writing, my research question had become burried underneath much of my elaboration or explanations - so I went back and directly stated it, right in my introduction.</p>
